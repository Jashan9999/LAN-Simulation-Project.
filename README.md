# LAN Simulation Project

# Purpose
This project demonstrates a Local Area Network (LAN) simulation using Cisco Packet Tracer. It highlights VLAN segmentation, inter-VLAN routing, and basic network setup for an organization.

# Network Topology
The network consists of a single router connected to a switch, which further connects to multiple PCs. VLANs are used to separate departments for better network management.

# VLANs
- VLAN 10 (Sales):Sales-1, Sales-2  
- VLAN 20 (HR): HR-1, HR-2

# Routing Protocols
- Inter-VLAN routing is configured on the HQ-Router-1 to allow communication between VLANs.

## How to Use
1. Download the `LAN-Simulation.pkt` file from this repository.
2. Open it using Cisco Packet Tracer.
3. Explore VLAN configurations and verify inter-VLAN connectivity using ping commands.
